jumping on the clouds
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/jumping-on-the-clouds/problem

Time complexity : O(n)

Space Complexity : constantly

better answer : in other way, using for insted while, but i want to write machinary code (not a performance issue, just like automata)

# Solve
```c++
int jumpingOnClouds(vector<int> c) {
    int count = 0;
    int cur = 0;
    int last = c.size() - 1;
    while(true){
        count++;
        if(cur+2 >= last)                   break;
        if(cur+2 < last && c[cur+2] == 0)   cur+=2;
        else                                ++cur;
    }
    return count;
}
```
